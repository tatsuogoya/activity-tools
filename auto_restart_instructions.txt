FEATURE: Auto-restart on Schedule for activity_keeper.py

Add an auto-restart feature that keeps the script running even outside work hours, automatically resuming activity when the schedule begins again.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Add command-line argument:
   - Add '--auto-restart' argument to argparse
   - Help text: "Automatically wait and restart when schedule begins (instead of exiting)"
   - Store as boolean

2. Add global variable:
   - Add 'AUTO_RESTART = False' near the top with other globals
   - Set it from args.auto_restart in main()

3. Create helper function to calculate next schedule start:
   - Function name: get_next_schedule_start()
   - Returns: datetime object of when work hours will next begin
   - Logic:
     * If currently within schedule, return current time (already started)
     * If before start time today and today is a work day, return today's start time
     * Otherwise, find the next work day and return its start time
     * Handle weekend -> Monday transition
     * Use work_hours_start and work_days from config

4. Modify main() function:
   - When schedule check fails (outside work hours), check if AUTO_RESTART is True
   - If AUTO_RESTART is True:
     * Don't exit the program
     * Calculate next schedule start using get_next_schedule_start()
     * Enter a waiting loop that:
       - Shows status in dashboard: "WAITING FOR SCHEDULE (Resumes at HH:MM on DAY)"
       - Sleeps for 1 minute
       - Rechecks if schedule has started
       - Allows exit via Ctrl+C or 'Q'
     * When schedule starts, continue with normal execution
   - If AUTO_RESTART is False, maintain current behavior (exit when outside schedule)

5. Modify keep_active() function:
   - When activity loop detects we've left the schedule (during the loop):
     * If AUTO_RESTART is True, break from activity loop and return to main() waiting state
     * If AUTO_RESTART is False, maintain current behavior (exit)

6. Update dashboard display:
   - Add a new status state: "WAITING" for when outside schedule but auto-restart is enabled
   - Show countdown or next start time in dashboard when waiting
   - Example: "Status: WAITING (Resumes at 09:00 on Monday)"

7. Logging:
   - Log when entering waiting mode: "Outside work hours, waiting for next schedule (resumes at HH:MM)"
   - Log when resuming from waiting mode: "Schedule started, resuming activity"

8. Update README.md:
   - Add '--auto-restart' to the command-line arguments section
   - Add explanation of use cases:
     * Running overnight/over weekend without manual restart
     * Automatic operation across schedule boundaries
     * Combining with quiet mode for background operation

IMPORTANT:
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Must work with schedule_enabled=false (just run continuously)
- Must respect pause/resume functionality even while waiting
- Must allow clean exit via Ctrl+C or 'Q' even while waiting
- Should work with all other features (verbose, quiet, profiles, etc.)
