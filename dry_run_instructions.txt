FEATURE: Dry-run Mode for activity_keeper.py

Add a dry-run mode that simulates activity without actually moving the mouse or pressing keys. This is useful for testing configuration, schedules, and behavior.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Add command-line argument:
   - Add '--dry-run' argument to argparse
   - Help text: "Run in dry-run mode (simulate activity without actually moving mouse/keyboard)"
   - Store as boolean

2. Add global variable:
   - Add 'DRY_RUN = False' near the top with other globals (VERBOSE, PAUSED, QUIET, etc.)
   - Set it from args.dry_run in main()

3. Modify perform_activity() function:
   - At the start of the function, check if DRY_RUN is True
   - If DRY_RUN is True:
     * Skip all actual pyautogui calls (pyautogui.press(), pyautogui.moveTo(), etc.)
     * Instead, log what WOULD have been done using verbose_log()
     * Example: verbose_log("DRY-RUN: Would have pressed Shift key")
     * Example: verbose_log(f"DRY-RUN: Would have moved mouse to ({x}, {y})")
   - Still perform all the sleep/wait operations so timing is realistic
   - Still count the activity in total_jiggles

4. Update dashboard display:
   - In draw_dashboard(), add "[DRY-RUN]" indicator next to the status if DRY_RUN is True
   - Example: "Status: RUNNING [DRY-RUN]" or "Status: PAUSED [DRY-RUN]"

5. Update README.md:
   - Add '--dry-run' to the command-line arguments section
   - Add a new section explaining dry-run mode use cases:
     * Testing configurations without triggering actual activity
     * Previewing schedule behavior
     * Debugging without side effects

IMPORTANT:
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Dry-run mode should work with all other features (verbose, quiet, profiles, etc.)
- The script should behave exactly the same except no actual mouse/keyboard activity occurs
- All logging, statistics, and dashboard updates should still work normally
